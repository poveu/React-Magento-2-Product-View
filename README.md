Project made while learning ReactJS (it's not intended to be perfect and will never be continued - I simply didn't want to create another ToDoList app ☺️).

**React-Magento-2-Product-View** communicates with a gateway script that connects to RestAPI of Magento 2 store, gets product data and displays it in user-friendly way, with pretty, Facebook-like placeholder, while loading data.
